# smrtl – Digital RTL for Mobile Genomics and Edge Bioinformatics

`smrtl` is a collection of Verilog RTL components and small systems
focused on **System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures for mobile bioinformatics**.

The emphasis is on blocks that are useful for:

- Nanopore and other sensor-based **signal processing pipelines**
- On-device **deep learning** and classical ML for genomic workloads
- Integration of **custom accelerators** with simple processor cores
- Teaching and experimentation (students can plug accelerators into
  mock CPUs and run them through rich testbenches)

The repository is intentionally small and self-contained so it can be
used both as a research playground and as a teaching resource.
